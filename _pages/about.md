Music and beyond 🎧; I'm a computer science PhD candidate doing research at the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic journey as a clarinetist and earned an undergraduate degree in musicology. I engaged in industrial engineering projects during my master's studies, which led me to become an interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of sound, human, and interaction design.

I am developing a creativity support tool for sonic interaction design that applies cognitive principles of tonal music.
