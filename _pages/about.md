Music and beyond 🎧; I'm a computer science PhD candidate doing research at the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic career as a clarinetist and pursued an undergraduate degree in musicology, with a keen interest in anthropology. I experienced engineering projects within the fields of industrial engineering during master's studies. This journey led me to become an interdisciplinary sound and music researcher, focusing on music, human, and interaction design.
