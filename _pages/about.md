I'm currently a PhD student conducting research at the intersections of sound, music, and human-computer interaction at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic career as a clarinetist and pursued a undergraduate degree in musicology and music theory, with a keen interest in anthropology. During my master's, I explored more practical methods within the subfields of industrial engineering. This journey led me to become an interdisciplinary music researcher, currently enrolled in a computer science PhD program with a focus on sound, music, and human-computer interaction.
