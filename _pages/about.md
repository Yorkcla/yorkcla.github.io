Music and beyond 🎧; I'm a computer science PhD student conducting research at the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [The Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic career as a clarinetist and pursued a undergraduate degree in musicology, with a keen interest in anthropology. I explored engineering projects within the field of human factors as well. This journey led me to become an interdisciplinary music researcher, focusing on music, human, and interaction design.
