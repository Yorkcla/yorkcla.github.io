*Music and beyond* 🎧 I'm a computer science PhD candidate at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/), working where sound, music, and HCI meet. I actually started out as a clarinetist and studied musicology and music theory at [SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). During my master’s in industrial engineering, I got into human factors and worked on industry projects involving sonic applications. I’m currently building an AI-assisted creativity tool that helps sound design practitioners understand user workflows and apply tonal principles that align with how end-users naturally perceive things, so they can bring them directly into their design practice.
