Music and beyond 🎧; I'm a computer science PhD candidate exploring the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic journey as a clarinetist, studying musicology and music theory. During my master’s in industrial engineering, I focused on human factors and eagaged with engineering projects. 

I am currently developing an AI-augmented creativity support tool for sonic interaction design that applies cognitive principles of tonal music.
