*Music and beyond* 🎧 I'm a computer science PhD candidate at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/), working where sound, music, and HCI meet. I started out as a clarinetist and studied musicology and music theory at [SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). During my master’s in industrial engineering, I got into human factors and worked on industry projects involving sonic applications. I’m developing an AI-assisted creativity support tool that helps sound design practitioners organise user workflows and apply tonal principles aligned with end-users’ perception.
