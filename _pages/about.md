Music and beyond 🎧; I'm a computer science PhD candidate doing research at the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic journey as a clarinetist, leading to an undergraduate degree in musicology. I engaged in industrial engineering projects during my master's studies in human factors. 

I am currently developing an AI-augmented creativity support tool for sonic interaction design that applies cognitive principles of tonal music.
