Music and beyond 🎧 

I'm a computer science PhD candidate exploring the intersections of sound, music, and HCI at [ANU](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I began my academic journey as a clarinetist, studying musicology and music theory at [SNU](https://en.snu.ac.kr/). During my master’s in industrial engineering at the same university, I focused on human factors and engaged with industry design projects. 

I'm currently developing an AI-assisted creativity support tool that helps sound interface designers apply cognitive principles of tonal music in their design practice.
