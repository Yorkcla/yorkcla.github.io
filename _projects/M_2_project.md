This project presents the results of a usability test for in-vehicle virtual sound, conducted in collaboration with Harman International. This is a part of my Master's thesis. Below is the abstract. 

Automotive manufacturers are engaging with audio system providers to offer unique auditory experiences. This is achieved through the replication of acoustic environments, coinciding with the growing prominence of infotainment systems. Gaining an understanding of how acoustical parameters impact human perception is essential in the development of virtual acoustic venues within this context. Hence, this is an initial study to explore the correlation between objective measures and subjective responses in reproduced in-vehicle virtual acoustics, with the aim of augmenting the auditory experience for passengers. A jury test was conducted, and the resulting data was subjected to statistical analysis. The findings align with previous studies except for intimacy, indicating visual disparities in virtual environments. Also, while reverberance, linked to envelopment, tends to be influenced by early decay time, optimizing reverberation time within a specific range can improve the auditory experience in vehicles by enhancing naturality, which is correlated with key variables including reverberance, envelopment, and overall impression.
