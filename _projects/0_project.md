    A music-theoretical approach to auditory interface, followed by the development of a design method and a supporting tool.

Music activities offer individuals an opportunity to engage in various cognitive interactions with sound, a phenomenon which has been studied from music theoretical perspectives. This cognitive trait is not limited to the arts but also extends to the development of auditory interfaces for everyday products. However, uncertainties still exist regarding the current theoretical framework to move beyond abstract concepts and towards practical design methodologies. To address this issue, my doctoral research focuses on exploring a method for sound production that employs tonal music theories, creating an accessible and explainable system for auditory interface design. This approach will result in a systematic methodology covering sound progression that can respond to user scenarios, allowing designers and researchers to better describe their design and analysis. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the end-user experience by making sound design more accessible to a broader people, opening the door to diverse and logical sound creation.
