Sonification, translating data into audible forms by mapping it to sound parameters, has been explored in various contexts, often harnessing musical principles to enhance daily sonic interactions; however, defining coherent research trends at the intersection of sonification and music remains a challenge. Accordingly, this literature review examines 199 articles, categorizing them by research themes and musical applications. Eight thematic categories emerged: art, design, emotion, medicine, movement, nature, space, and vision, with musical cases largely falling within the zero to one dimensional range defined in this paper. We have identified four discussion topics interpreting the dynamics surrounding the classified findings: thematic interrelations centered on the interplay between medicine and vision, music as a universal catalyst in interactive sonification, ideal musical depth beyond basic conception, and strategic variable positioning with music understanding. Realizing the rational expertise inherent to music and aptly leveraging the musical reasoning for interactive sonification enable the persuasive sonic interaction for all by the artistic value of music.
