Sonification, translating data into audible forms through the mapping of data elements to sound parameters, often considering musical elements, has gained prominence in multidisciplinary contexts. However, defining coherent research trends at the intersection of sonification and music remains a challenge. This systematic literature review examines 199 articles, categorizing them by research themes and musical applications. 8 thematic categories emerged: art, design, emotion, medicine, movement, nature, space, and vision, with most prevalent musical applications falling within zero to one dimension. Analyzing thematic relationships, especially in medicine and vision, reveals pervasive sonification trends rather than exceptions based on musical applications. We found that studies tend to focus on single sound variables, neglecting the systematic and experiential aspects of music. Studies often explore simpler artistic integration with music and occasionally misuse musical terminology. Acknowledging the inherent systematicity of music and precise mapping of variables with musical knowledge are crucial in sonification design and related research.
