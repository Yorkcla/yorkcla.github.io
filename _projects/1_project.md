Sonification, translating data into audible forms by mapping it to sound parameters, has been explored in various contexts, often
harnessing musical principles to enhance daily sonic interactions; however, defining coherent research trends at the intersection of
sonification and music remains a challenge. Accordingly, this review examines 199 articles, categorising them by research themes and
musical applications through thematic analysis. Eight thematic categories emerged: art, design, emotion, medicine, movement, nature,
space, and vision, with musical cases largely falling within the zero to one dimensional range defined in this paper. We have identified
four discussion topics interpreting the dynamics surrounding the classified findings: thematic interrelations centred on the interplay
between medicine and vision, music as a universal catalyst in interactive sonification, ideal musical depth beyond basic conception,
and strategic variable positioning with music understanding. This study contributes by categorising literature on sonification and
music, uncovering intertwined trends in interdisciplinary settings, and offering insights for future research opportunities.
