When we listen to tonal music across different genres, we naturally sense tension and release as the sound progresses. This is because we intuitively follow the cognitive flow shaped by tonal structures and their interaction with broader musical elements. Understanding these tonal dynamics offers persuasive possibilities for designing intuitive sonic interactions through auditory interface design, supported by AI applications that enhance practitioner accessibility.

In this overview, I will share my PhD journey exploring musical tension and release in sonic interaction design through the development of a practical design framework and a creativity support tool. I will begin with an overview of the research, outlining its purpose, research questions, and methods, along with the five projects that were conducted. I will then introduce the design framework that brings musical tension and release into sonic interaction design, followed by a walkthrough of each project to illustrate how they shaped the final design tool and supported the practical application of tonal principles. To conclude, I will reflect on the outcomes across projects and discuss the broader contributions and implications of this work.

My PhD contributes to both research and practice by applying tonal principles to sonic interaction design and enhancing practical accessibility through a framework and a design support tool, each validated through multiple evaluations. This work addresses a gap in the interdisciplinary areas of sound, music, and human–computer interaction by applying structured musical knowledge to challenges in design practice, enabled through computational design assistance. These contributions demonstrate the practical value of tonal cognition for supporting designers in creating effective sonic interactions for end-users.
