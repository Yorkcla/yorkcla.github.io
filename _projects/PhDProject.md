When we listen to tonal music, we naturally sense tension and release because we intuitively follow the cognitive flow shaped by tonal structures. My PhD investigates how these tonal dynamics can support intuitive sonic interaction design by developing a design framework and an AI-assisted creativity support tool that help practitioners apply musical principles in accessible ways. Through five interconnected projects, I examined how tonal cognition can be integrated into design practice, created and refined a practical framework, and demonstrated its application through a functioning tool that organises workflows and supports sound decisions. This research contributes to both theory and practice by translating structured musical knowledge into actionable design methods and showing how tonal principles combined with AI support can help designers create effective and intuitive sonic interactions for end-users.
