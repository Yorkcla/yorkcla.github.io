    How can tonal music principles and the needs of designers be incorporated in sound design tools? 
</div> 

Research into tonal music examines the structural relationships among sounds and how they align with our auditory perception. The exploration of integrating tonal cognition into sonic interac- tion design, particularly for practitioners lacking extensive musical knowledge, and developing an accessible software tool, remains limited. We report on a study of designers to understand the sound creation practices of industry experts and explore how infusing tonal music principles into a sound design tool can better sup- port their craft and enhance the sonic experiences they create. Our study collected qualitative data through semi-structured individual and focus group interviews with six participants. We developed a low-fidelity prototype sound design tool that involves practical methods of functional harmony and interaction design discussed in focus groups. We identified four themes through reflexive thematic analysis: decision-making, domain knowledge and terminology, collaboration, and contexts in sound creation. Finally, we discussed design considerations for an accessible sonic interaction design tool that aligns auditory experience more closely with tonal cognition.
