    How can tonal music principles and the needs of designers be incorporated in sound design tools? 
</div> 

Research into tonal music examines the structural relationships among sounds and how they align with our auditory perception. Incorporating tonal music principles into sound design, particularly for individuals without a musical background who work with sonic interfaces across various settingsâ€”from personal device notifications to machinery states, accessibility audio aids, and sounds for public spaces like hospitals and airportsâ€”remains largely unexplored. We report an early-stage study to understand the sound creation practices of industry experts and explore how applying tonal music principles can support their craft and enhance the sonic experiences they create. We have identified four themes through semi-structured interviews, focus groups, reflections on a low-fidelity prototype, and thematic analysis. These themes present the DIS community with future research opportunities on sonic interface design tools that integrate tonal music principles, leading to auditory experiences that closely match our auditory perception and promote more inclusive sonic environments.
