    Research overview: theoretical review, insights for framework development, and a sonic interaction design framework for practitioners using musical tension and release, featuring 3-step guidelines, 2 advanced options, and 3 GenAI applications.

Sonic interaction designs can be enhanced by considering the music cognitive processes of tension and release. However, existing design models for applying these principles lack accessibility for practitioners, and practical guidelines remain underdeveloped. We propose a practitioner-oriented framework for designing sonic interactions that foregrounds music cognition concepts. Our framework connects music cognition and interaction design by aligning methods for functional harmony with workflow analysis. We articulate a cohesive three-step strategy, extendable for advanced practitioners, and explore opportunities for generative AI to support the design process. Our design framework links theoretical foundations in functional harmony and workflow with practical applications, aiming to accessibly create sonic interactions that effectively communicate with users. This work contributes design guidelines for practitioners, promoting the broader adoption of musical tension and release, and setting the stage for future empirical research.
